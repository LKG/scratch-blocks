# To-Do list for scratch-blocks un-fork

Before this un-forked version of `scratch-blocks` is fully ready for release, we need to:

- [ ] Hook up i18n / l10n
- [x] Fix or remove Husky
- [ ] Set up CI & CD
- [ ] Wait for Blockly v12 release, then update Blockly dependencies accordingly

Things we need to do before we consider this project "done" but could wait until after the initial release:

- [ ] Decide what we want to do about tests, then do it
- [ ] Pick linting rules, apply them, and enforce them
- [ ] Make sure the gh-pages setup is doing what we want, or remove it
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Remove this TODO file once it's empty :)
